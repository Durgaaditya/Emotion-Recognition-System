# Emotion-Recognition-System
This project is a Speech Emotion Recognition system using Python and TensorFlow that detects emotions from voice recordings. It processes audio with MFCC features, trains a neural network on the RAVDESS dataset, and predicts emotions from `.wav` files. Runs entirely in VS Code.
